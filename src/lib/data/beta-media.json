					"transcript": "looking for a new switch to add to your network Cisco Catalyst 1200 and 1300 switches offer a strong platform for commercial applications that's easy to deploy and manage in this edition of Cisco tech talk I'll explain some Catalyst 1200 and 1300 features and configurations next [Music] I'll begin by covering the global LEDs on the switch when the switch is powered on and Performing self-tests or acquiring an IP address the system LED lights flash steadily green if the LED flashes Amber the switch has detected one of the following a configuration file error a hardware failure or a firmware failure the switch comes with the factory default IP address of 192.168.1.254 and a subnet mask of Slash 24. when the switch is using this factory default IP address the system LED continuously flashes you will see a steady green when the switch is using a dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP server assigned IP address this is typical since DHCP is enabled by default if you have configured a static IP address you will also see a steady green LED the c1200 and c1300 switches provide a simple intuitive dashboard that automates switch deployment monitoring and life cycle management a resource utilization graph the system Health display and a brief overview of the ram logs are easily accessible next I'll walk you through the process of installing and managing your device to get started you need to log into the web user interface connect your computer to one of the switchboards with an ethernet cable make sure everything is powered on your computer needs to be on the same IP subnet of the switch any address from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.253 if it is not you will need to temporarily change the IP address on your computer from that IP pool open a web browser and enter the IP address of the switch 192.168.1.254 this is the default address when you first log into the switch the username and password are both Cisco and all lowercase letters after this initial login you will have to change both the username and password once that is set head to the configuration wizard section of the navigation pane from here you can configure the switch by using the various links and following the on-screen instructions let's run the getting started wizard you can use the default hostname or create a new one this screen can be used to generate a new IP address the systems interface choosing none will keep the current settings the system clock can be set using a simple Network time protocol sntp server alternatively the date and time can be imported from a local computer now you can move on to the VLAN Setup Wizard here you can select the interface that will serve as your trunk interface Port 9 will be used in this example since it is connected to my router you can also use this panel to create a new VLAN I'll designate VLAN 10 as admin Port 9 will serve as the trunk port for untagged VLAN 10 traffic VLAN 10 can also have access interfaces added to it on this switch I will choose ports 5 and 6. to examine the file management for the switch navigate to administration file management and then firmware operations a file management system application will organize and save the access files on your device these system files include configuration data and the firmware image here you can manage the firmware file that is used with the reboot modify configuration files internally and copy files to and from an external device [Music] for this next feature select Administration and then the system log section select log settings by default system logs are enabled system logging allows a device to produce multiple independent logs each log is a collection of messages that describe system events the pin utility is another useful feature of the switch a ping test sees if a remote host can be reached and notes the round trip time for each packet sent ping works by sending internet control message protocol or icmp Echo request packets to the Target host once sent it waits for an icmp Echo reply when it is received it calculates the round trip time and Records any packet loss power over Ethernet or Poe can be very beneficial on the switch if you can power devices with the switch it can eliminate expensive wiring reduce the number of cables and easily expand the network the c1200 and c1300 series switches support IEEE 802.3az standards IEEE 802.3bt Poe and IEEE 802.318 Poe plus up to 30 watts per Port the poe power allocation is dynamic and power mapping scales up to a maximum of 740 watts of Poe plus power intelligent power management allows for flexible power allocation across all ports with Perpetual Poe the poe plus power is maintained during a switch reload the last feature I want to highlight is web-based Authentication this feature provides a consistent interface to authenticate all types of host devices and operating systems eliminating the complexity of deploying IEEE 802.1x clients on each endpoint there you have it this has been a quick overview of the Catalyst 1200 and 1300 switches thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

							"transcript": "Cisco Catalyst 1200 and 1300 series switches our fixed managed gigabit Ethernet Enterprise light layer 2 switches these switches are simple flexible and secure they've been designed for small to medium-sized businesses and Branch offices the C 1200 and C 1300 models operate on Linux based software they support simple device management with network reliability and operational efficiency providing the ideal combination of affordability and capabilities this switch helps you create a more efficient better connected Network there are two ways to do configurations you can use the command line or web user interface if you prefer to use the web user interface click the link in the description in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll go through the day Zero setup of a new or factory reset Catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch using the command line interface for CLI [Music] for this demonstration my computer is connected to a c1300 switch with a console cable the process is the same for the C 1200 series as well this switch has been factory reset and is in the process of booting up if your switch is new out of the box you don't need to perform a factory reset once the switch is up it's going to go through the initial setup options this involves setting a username and password these credentials will be used to manage the switch as you can see on the screen you'll be prompted to press enter twice to complete the console boudreate Auto detection process this is necessary to identify the speed of the console connection and to send data at the proper rate since this is a day Zero setup of a factory reset switch enter the default username and password which is Cisco for both all lowercase letters press enter on the keyboard next you'll be prompted to change the default credentials you must enter a new username and password that meets the complexity rules you can't use Cisco or any variation of the word no common passwords are allowed you cannot use more than three repeated characters in a row for example 111 will not be accepted additionally using more than two sequential characters in a row like one two three won't work for this example I'm going to enter the username as admin if I enter a password that doesn't comply with the rules like cisco123 it'll be rejected along with an explanation of why it isn't allowed after you enter acceptable credentials you'll receive a message that the username and password were successfully updated at this point you're connected via the console cable and can manage it using the CLI next I'll go over a few common things you might want to do during the initial setup configure the IP address set a default gateway and enable secure shell SSH I'll start with setting up an IP address enter config terminal to enter the global configuration mode on this switch for this example I'll configure the interface VLAN 1 to log in to the VLAN 1 interface configuration mode enter the command IP address followed by the IP and the subdent mask on my network that's 172.16.1.11 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 this command will assign that IP address to the VLAN 1 interface to get out of the interface mode enter the command exit from the global configuration mode you can specify the IP route as a side note if you come to a situation where you don't know the next part of the command you can type a question mark to get help as I did here it states that I need to enter the destination prefix in this case it's going to be my default gateway so I'll enter 0.0.0.0 as the destination prefix with 0.0.0.0 as the network mask followed by the Gateway IP address of my network to enable SSH clients type ipssh client authentication password that allows the use of a username and password to authenticate via SSH after that exit the configuration mode to get back to the privileged exec mode enter right memory to save the configuration enter y to confirm and you're all set nice work you've now completed the basic initial configuration of your Catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch using CLI thanks for watching I'll see you next time"

							"transcript": "Cisco Catalyst 1200 and 1300 series switches our fixed managed gigabit Ethernet Enterprise light layer 2 switches these switches are simple flexible and secure they've been designed for small to medium-sized businesses and Branch offices the c1200 and c1300 models operate on Linux based software they support simple device management with network reliability and operational efficiency providing the ideal combination of affordability and capabilities this switch helps you create a more efficient better connected Network in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll go through the day Zero setup on a catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch using the web user interface [Music] first things first log into the switch by entering the username and password in this video I'll be using a c1300 switch but the process is the same for a c1200 switch as well since the switch is new out of the box enter Cisco for both the username and password to log in all lowercase letters once you're logged in it'll prompt you to set a new username and password you can't keep Cisco for either one for this example I'll use admin for the username to have an acceptable password you need to make it complex and follow certain criteria you could use the suggest password option by clicking on it it'll give you a strong password if you want to use this as your password simply click on copy to clipboard and paste it into the password field in this case I'll enter my own password if you also choose to enter your own password you need to know a few things that are not allowed for security purposes you can't use Cisco or any variation of the word no common passwords are allowed you cannot use more than three repeated characters in a row for example one one one will not be accepted additionally using more than two sequential characters in a row like one two three will not be allowed once you have a password that will be accepted enter it in the provided field enter it again to confirm and then click apply now that you have a new password set you'll be prompted to log in with these new credentials enter the username and password that you just configured at this point the switch is up and ready to use to save the configuration click the blinking red save icon at the top of the screen great your switch has a basic setup next I'll go over a few common steps that you may want to do along with this initial configuration in some cases you may want to set a static IP address as opposed to using Dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP to set a static IP navigate to ipv4 configuration in the main menu and then click on ipv4 interface select the interface and click edit on the edit IP interface window select static IP address under IP address type and click apply if you want to change this address to something new click on the plus icon to add an IP interface here the IP address type will be static enter the IP address of your choice and the subnet mask in the provided fields when you click apply it's important to remember that the IP address has changed therefore you need to disconnect from the current web browser session and log in using a different window you'll see a pop-up window with a warning it states that the DHCP address will be deleted while using a static address as both will be on the same VLAN and on the same subnet click ok to confirm now you can log in using the new IP address with the same username and password save the configuration one more time this makes sure the IP address doesn't change if you reboot the switch after specifying a static IP address you need to go through a few more configuration steps first to add the IP address of your default gateway go to ipv4 configuration in the navigation Pane and click on ipv4 static routes click on the plus icon and enter the destination IP prefix Network mask and the next hop router IP address all zeros with a zero prefix indicate the route of Last Resort where all the packets will go if there is not a learned or static route next you need to configure your DNS server by navigating to General ipconfiguration under DNS click on DNS settings here enter the server IP address and click apply be sure to save your configuration there you go you're set to manage your Catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch using the web user interface thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]"

					"intro": "Network communication between surveillance devices such as cameras and monitoring equipment should often be given higher priority and it is important that the various devices that comprise the surveillance infrastructure in the organization are reachable for each other. Normally, the network administrator ensures that all surveillance devices are connected to the same VLAN and to configure this VLAN and the interfaces on it to allow for this high priority traffic. ASV automates aspects of this setup by detecting defined surveillance devices on the network, assigns them to a VLAN, and sets their traffic priority. The surveillance devices are defined by creating a list of OUIs and MAC addresses. Up to 32 sources for surveillance traffic can be defined in any combination of MAC and OUIs.",

The Cisco Catalyst 1200 and 1300 switches fit the bill that also provide advanced switching capabilities, enhanced security, and can be easily managed using the Cisco Business Dashboard or the Cisco Business mobile App. Check out the following pages for more information on the Catalyst 1200 and 1300 switches. <ul> <li>  <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-1200-series-switches/nb-06-cat1200-1300-ser-upgrade-cte-en.html\">   Why Upgrade to Cisco Catalyst 1200 or 1300 Series Switches Feature Comparison  </a> </li> <li>  <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-1200-series-switches/nb-06-cat1200-1300-ser-aag-cte-en.html\">   Cisco Catalyst 1200 and 1300 Series Switches At-a-Glance  </a> </li></ul> The Bluetooth support on the Catalyst switches enables IP connectivity over Bluetooth to manage the switch. The Catalyst switches support Bluetooth through an add on USB Bluetooth dongle that can be plugged in to the USB port of the switch. This allows users to create a Personal Area Network (PAN) over the Bluetooth connection which then can be used to manage the switch using http, https, telnet or SSH. List of supported dongles: <ul> <li>  BTD-400 Bluetooth 4.0 Adapter by Kinivo </li> <li>  Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter by Asus </li> <li>  Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter by Insignia </li> <li>  Philips 4.0 Bluetooth adapter </li> <li>  Lenovo LX1815 Bluetooth 5.0 USB adapter </li> <li>  Lenovo LX1812 Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter </li></ul>",

					"intro": "Dying Gasp is a feature that is available only on the Catalyst 1300 series switches and provides a mechanism to alert monitoring systems that the device is experiencing an unexpected loss of power before it loses connection. When a loss of power event occurs, a hardware capacitor will delay the device shutting down for a short time. During this time, the device will send Dying Gasp messages via configured Syslog servers or SNMP notification recipients that can be used to identify the cause of the issue and troubleshoot. You can configure Dying Gasp via the CLI using simple commands. Keep reading to find out more.",
