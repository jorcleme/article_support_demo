    "brownfield_plan_the_deployment": "Plan the deployment: Before deploying a new switch into an existing network, it is crucial to plan the deployment. This includes identifying the location of the switch, the number of users that will be connected to it, and the type of devices that will be connected to it. In mixed vendor environments, consider the compatibility between the new switch and existing devices to avoid potential interoperability issues. For hybrid infrastructures, ensure seamless connectivity between on-premises and cloud-based components. Planning helps ensure that the switch is configured correctly and meets the needs of the network.",
    "brownfield_test_the_switch": "Test the switch before deployment: Before deploying the switch into the existing network, it is important to test it first. This will help to ensure that the switch is working properly and that it is configured correctly. Testing can include verifying that the switch is connected to the correct VLAN, that all ports are functioning correctly, and that the switch is configured to support the required protocols. In mixed vendor settings, validate the switch's interoperability with other vendors' devices. For hybrid networks, check the switch's ability to support communication between on-premises and cloud resources.",
    "brownfield_document_deployment": "Document the deployment: After deploying the switch into the existing network, it is important to document the deployment. This includes recording the switch's location, its configuration, and the devices that are connected to it. This information can be used to troubleshoot any issues that may arise in the future and to help ensure that the network is running efficiently. Additionally, it is important to update any network diagrams or documentation to reflect the new switch's deployment. In mixed vendor environments and hybrid infrastructures, document any specific configurations or settings required to maintain compatibility and connectivity.",
